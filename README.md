# Verifiable Random Functions
This is the working area for the individual Internet-Draft "Verifiable Random Functions". Until 2020/11/09, the repo for the draft was [here](https://github.com/fcelda/nsec5-draft).


## Building the Draft

Formatted .txt and .html versions of the draft can be built from the .xml using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have the necessary software
(specifically, [xml2rfc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xml2rfc)) installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md).

## Reference Implementation

The purpose of the reference implementations is for generating test vectors and enabling cross compatibility with other implementations.  
This implementation is for reference only. It MUST NOT be used in production systems. It is [available here](https://github.com/reyzin/ecvrf).
